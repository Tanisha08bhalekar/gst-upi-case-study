# 📊 Case Study: UPI Payments Dropped During GST Panic (July 2025)

## 🔍 What Happened?

In July 2025, small business owners and shopkeepers started getting GST-related notices. This caused panic, especially online.

At the same time, UPI payments suddenly dropped.

As an analyst i wanted to understand:

- Did UPI usage really fall in the cities where notices went out?
- Were those users GST-registered?
- What were users saying online?

---

## 🛠️ What I Did

- Pulled city-wise UPI transaction data  
- Collected GST info to see which user types were affected  
- Read real user comments from online forums  
- Used Power BI to bring all the data into one clear dashboard

---

## 💡 What I Found

- Cities with many notices showed big UPI payment drops  
- Many affected users were not even GST-registered just confused  
- People were asking for help, but didn’t get clear answers  

---

## ✅ What Could've Helped

- A simple in-app message or alert about the notice  
- A short help guide or FAQ  
- Easy access to support to avoid panic

## 📉 Why This Matters

When users panic:

- They stop using the app  
- Revenue drops  
- Support gets overloaded  
- User trust falls  

That’s bad for the business.

## 💬 My Take

If I were a business analyst at the company, I’d want to catch this early and help the product, marketing, and support teams fix it before things got worse.

This wasn’t just about making a dashboard — but solving a real business problem. The kind analysts and product teams deal with every day.

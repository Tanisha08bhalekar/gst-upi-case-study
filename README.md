📌 Case Study: UPI Payments Drop During GST Panic (July 2025)
*What Happened?
In July 2025, small business owners and shopkeepers started receiving GST-related notices. This created panic and people started talking about it online. Right around the same time, UPI payments suddenly dropped.

As someone interested in business analysis, I wanted to understand:

-Did UPI usage actually fall in areas where GST notices went out?
-Were these users GST-registered or not?
-What were users saying online?

*What I Did?
-I checked UPI transactions city by city to see where the drop happened.
-Looked at GST data to find out which users got affected.
-Read real user comments to see what people were saying online.
-Then used Power BI to put it all together in one clear dashboard.

*What I Found?
-I checked UPI transactions city by city to see where the drop happened.
-Looked at GST data to find out which users got affected.
-Read real user comments to see what people were saying online.
-Then used Power BI to put it all together in one clear dashboard.

*What Could've Helped?
-A simple in-app message or alert explaining the notice.
-A small help guide or FAQ section.
-A visible support contact could’ve reduced panic.


*When people get confused or scared, they stop using the app.
That means:
-Less money comes in
-More people call for help
-And users stop trusting the app
-All this is bad for the business.

*My Take
'"If I was a business analyst there, I’d want to catch this early and help the team fix it before it confused more users."

“This wasn’t just a dashboard project I wanted to solve a real problem. The kind of work business analysts actually do.”

*Tools Used
-Power BI
-Python (for data cleaning)
-Excel
